Airbnb Mock Coding Project - Docker Setup
This project aims to create a mock Airbnb application using Docker for easy setup and deployment. Docker allows for containerization of the application, making it easier to manage dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different systems.

Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure that you have the following software installed on your system:

Docker: Install Docker
Getting Started
To set up the Airbnb mock coding project using Docker, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd airbnb-mock-project
Build the Docker image:
bash
Copy code
docker build -t airbnb-mock .
Run the Docker container:
bash
Copy code
docker run -p 8080:8080 airbnb-mock
This command will start the application and map port 8080 of the container to port 8080 on your local machine.

Access the application
Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:8080 to access the Airbnb mock application.

Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

arduino
Copy code
.
├── app
│   ├── controllers
│   ├── models
│   ├── views
│   ├── config.py
│   └── main.py
├── Dockerfile
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
The app directory contains the main application code, including controllers, models, views, and the main application file (main.py).
The Dockerfile defines the instructions for building the Docker image.
The requirements.txt file lists the Python dependencies required by the application.
Customization and Configuration
If your application requires additional dependencies, update the requirements.txt file with the necessary packages.
Modify the application code in the app directory according to your specific requirements.
You can configure environment-specific settings in the config.py file.
